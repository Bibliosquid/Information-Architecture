## About me

I'm a former academic librarian with years of teaching experience and plenty of time writing research guides, how-tos, documentation of processes and policies, and other related duties. As an academic librarian, my job has been teaching college students how to do research, use complex research databases, format documents, print, use a variety of software, and other tools. As a bit of a systems nerd, I have spent time organizing our sharepoint, developed an internal knowledge base, and begun work on a full information architecture redesign of our internal pages. To best help my users, I've spent a lot of time creating tutorials, instructions, guides, FAQs, etc. I genuinely enjoy writing instructions and helping users navigate tricky systems.

Prior to becoming a librarian, I worked as an academic program manager and a freelance graphic designer, and use my project management skills and design expertise in current projects. Some of my samples represent edited versions of past projects that are internal documentation and therefore not available publically, while others reference projects I've conducted as a librarian. I am very skilled at relationship building and working cross-departmentally, and pick up technology tools quickly, including Sharepoint, JIRA, and CMS platforms. I am familiar with XML, JSON, and DITA, and am comfortable with HTML and CSS.
